                <h2>Solo Kayaking</h2>
                <p>
                    Our solo kayaking trips are designed for experienced paddlers looking for a challenge. Navigate
                    through exciting rapids and enjoy the tranquility of the river at your own pace. Our guides are
                    available for support and safety, but this adventure is all about you. You won't be out there alone
                    - we raft in minimums of 10 kayakers and two guides. It is rare to fall below our minimum. It is
                    helpful if you bring a friend or two, but generally not necessary.
